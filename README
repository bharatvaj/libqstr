libqstr
=======
libqstr is a simple string library that is based heavily on the SDS(Simple dynamic String) library with focus on simplicity and portability.

The whole layout in memory of a string created with libqstr looks like this
	--------------------------
	|STRSIZE|...C-STRING...|0|
	--------------------------

Usage
-----
`qstr` is the string type provided by this library which should be used to call all the qstr* APIs. `qstr` is a simple typedef to `char*`

All the APIs are documented in qstr.h. Usage examples can be found in test.c.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (qstr is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install libqstr (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Comparison with SDS
-------------------
* libqstr uses size_t as the metadata for the string instead of a header struct.
* sds's API is not very consistent. The functions names are a mix between c style function names and camelcase. libqstr follows the std library's naming conventions for it's functions with qstr* prepended.
